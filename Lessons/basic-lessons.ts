// NODEJS:
// Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run 
// JavaScript code outside of a web browser — typically on a server.

// 🧠 Core Idea
// Traditionally, JavaScript ran only in browsers (like Chrome or Firefox) to make web pages interactive.
// Node.js lets you use JavaScript on the server side, enabling you to build complete web applications (front end + back end) using a single language.

// 💡 Common Uses

// 1. Building web servers and RESTful APIs

// 2. Creating real-time applications (e.g., chat apps, online games)

// 3. Developing microservices

// 4. Command-line tools and scripts

// 5. Streaming applications (video/audio)

// 6. Serverless functions (in cloud environments)

// 📦 Key Features

// 1. npm (Node Package Manager): Comes with Node.js and gives access to hundreds of thousands of reusable open-source libraries.

// 2. Cross-platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

// 3. Large ecosystem: Massive community and support base.

// Playwright:
// Playwright is an open-source end-to-end testing framework developed by Microsoft that allows you to automate browsers
// — such as Chromium (Chrome, Edge), Firefox, and WebKit (Safari) — for testing and web scraping purposes.
// In simple terms, Playwright helps you simulate real user interactions with a website (like clicking buttons, filling forms, or navigating pages) 
// — all through code.

// 🧠 Core Idea
// Playwright is designed to help developers test how their web apps behave across different browsers, devices, and network conditions — automatically.
// It’s especially useful for UI testing, functional testing, and browser automation.

// ⚙️ Key Features
// 1. Cross-browser: Works with Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit (so you can test Chrome, Edge, Safari, and Firefox).

// 2. Cross-platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

// 3. Cross-language: Supports JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET.

// 4. Headless or headed mode: Can run without showing a browser window (for speed) or visibly (for debugging).

// 5. Automatic waiting: Playwright waits for elements to be ready before interacting — reducing flakiness.

// 6. Parallel testing: Can run multiple tests simultaneously for faster execution.

// 7. Network control: Lets you intercept, mock, or modify network requests.

// 8. Screenshots and videos: Can capture screenshots or videos of tests for debugging.

// 💡 Common Use Cases
// 1. End-to-end (E2E) testing: Ensure that entire workflows (like signup → login → checkout) work correctly.

// 2. Cross-browser testing: Verify that your site behaves consistently on Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.

// 3. Web scraping: Extract information from websites.

// 4. Performance testing: Measure load times or response speeds.

// 5. Visual regression testing: Compare screenshots to detect UI changes.

// Postman:
// Postman is a collaboration and testing tool for APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). 
// It helps developers design, test, debug, and document APIs easily — all in one place.
// Think of it as a powerful tool to send requests and inspect responses between a client (like your app) 
// and a server — without having to write any code just to test an API.

// 🧠 Core Idea
// When building software, especially web or mobile apps, you often need to communicate with a server through an API.
// Postman lets you simulate those API calls — so you can check:

// Is the API working?

// What data does it return?

// What happens if you send invalid input?

// 💡 Common Use Cases
// 1. Testing and debugging REST or GraphQL APIs

// 2. Automating regression tests for APIs

// 3. Creating API documentation

// 4. Mocking or simulating APIs for front-end testing

// 5. Monitoring API performance


// Visual Studio Code (VS Code):
// Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. 
// It’s one of the most popular tools used by developers for writing and editing code — lightweight like a text editor, 
// but powerful enough to handle full-scale software projects.

// 🧠 Core Idea
// VS Code is designed to be fast, flexible, and extensible — so you can use it for almost 
// any programming language or development environment by adding extensions.
